/* ------------------- WINDOW FUNCTIONS BASICS ------------------- 
They are used to apply a function to a "window" of data
Windows are essentially groups of rows of data.

ROW_NUMBER() function returns a series of numbers for each window

Difference with aggregate functions such as GROUP BY is that aggregate functions collapse
rows in each group and apply a calculation, but window functions leave the rows as they are
and apply calculations by window


------------- COMPONENTS
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY country ORDER BY happiness_score)

1. ROW_NUMBER - Function to apply to each window. Others include ROW_NUMBER, FIRST_VALUE, LAG (required)
2. OVER - States that this is a window function (required)
3. PARTITION BY - Shows how the rows are split into windows: one or multiple columns or entire table (optional)
4. ORDER BY - How each window should be sorted before a function is applied (optional for most RDBMS)
*/

-- Return all row numbers within each window
SELECT country, year, happiness_score,
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY country ORDER BY happiness_score DESC) AS row_num
FROM happiness_scores
ORDER BY country, row_num;


/* Given that we have an orders report with customer, order and transaction IDs, 
can you provide the transaction number for each customer as well? */
SELECT customer_id, order_id, transaction_id,
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY transaction_id) AS transaction_num
FROM orders
ORDER BY customer_id, transaction_id;


/* --------------- ROW NUMBERING ---------------- 

ROW_NUMBER() gives every row a unique number
RANK() account for ties
DENSE_RANK() accounts for ties and leave no missing numbers in between
*/

/* --------------- ROW_NUMBER vs RANK vs DENSE_RANK ----------------- */
-- Create a new table for the demo

/* --------------- FIRST_VALUE, LAST VALUE & NTH_VALUE ----------------- 
FIRST_VALUE() - extracts the first value in a window, in sequential row order
LAST_VALUE() - extracts the last value
NTH_VALUE() - extracts the value at a specified position

/* --------------- LEAD & LAG ----------------- 
LEAD() and LAG() allow you to return the value from the next and previous row respectively, within each window
*/

/* ----------------------------- NTILE -----------------------------------------
It divides the rows in a window into a specified number of percentiles.
